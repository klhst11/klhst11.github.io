Hello, my name is Kaden Helsel, and welcome to my website! I am currently a Freshman at Mount Aloysius studying IT. For my career, I want to become a Network and Computer Systems Administrator. I have always liked working with technology as a kid, always helping out someone to fix something that might not be working properly. As I got older, that's when I knew that going into IT would be the best thing for me.
