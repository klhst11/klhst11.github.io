Hello, my name is Kaden Helsel, and welcome to my website! I am currently a Freshman at Mount Aloysius studying IT. For my career, I want to become a Network and Computer Systems Administrator. I have always liked working with technology as a kid, always helping out someone to fix something that might not be working properly. As I got older, that's when I knew that going into IT would be the best thing for me. In creation of this website, I have added three pages. The first page is from one of my previous assignments where we had to talk about 4 of our favorite things, in which I chose fast food restuarants. The second page is from our Assignment 10, where we had to come up with something creative for this website we are building, which is a temperature converter. Lastly, my about page is pretty much a big background of things about me.
